[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/massemanet/eper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/massemanet/eper)

**This project has been parked. The most interesting bit ([redbug](http://github.com/massemanet/redbug)) has its own repository, _dtop_ has been reimplemented by OTP ([as _etop_](http://erlang.org/doc/man/etop.html)), the other stuff was not of much general interest. I'll accept pull requests, and keep the project compatible with modern OTP releases, for the foreseeable future. I don't plan to add new features.**

eper is a loose collection of Erlang Performance related tools.

* dtop   - similar to unix top
* ntop   - visualizes network traffic
* atop   - shows various aspects of the VM allocators
* redbug - similar to the OTP dbg application, but safer, better etc.
